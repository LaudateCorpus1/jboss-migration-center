Windup
------

Windup is a tool to simplify Java application migrations. Running from the command line, the tool analyzes artifacts from Java applications and produces an HTML report highlighting areas that require changes. The analyzer is driven by customizable and extendable rules to provide information to assist the developer in migrating applications. It's initial focus is Java EE applications but the Windup design and rule organization is general enough to allow Windup to be used for practically any kind of migration.
