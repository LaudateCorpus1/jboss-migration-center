Migration Drivers
=================

Business requirements today are constantly changing and evolving, often in unpredictable ways. Legacy technologies, while good in their day, can limit flexibility, and scalability, and can impact an IT organization's ability to respond quickly. Today, time to productivity is especially critical. 

Oftentimes the  best way to handle these new requirements is to migrate critical applications to a modern IT environment. 

In addition to changing business requirements, there are many more motivations behind an organization's decision to undertake a Java EE server migration.   Common reasons for server migration include:

		<td>Moving from  proprietary technologies that require high licensing fees, to the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform subscription provides organizations with substantially lower up-front costs and lower overall TCO.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Standards compliance:</td>
		<td>Not only has JBoss been a strong supporter of open standards, it has been instrumental in driving a lot of the innovation around open standard enterprise Java, including JPA, JSF, EJB, and CDI. Basing your infrastructure on an open implementation of open standards removes a great deal of risk when choosing a platform for the future.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Vendor lock-in:</td>
		<td>A lack of up-front licensing costs, combined with open standards compliance ensures that organizations are not locked into a single vendor and gives you the flexibility to take back ownership of your IT environment.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Technology Innovation with out sacrificing Security and stability: </td>
		<td>Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform provides both innovation (Software developed by a vibrant open source community) and security and stability (testing, certification, documentation, training, and support expected from mature enterprise software products). </td>

		<td>Corporate mandate for change:</td>

In many cases, a combination of motivations drive server migrations. Whereas no single motivation may be sufficient to warrant the move, the sum of the business objectives may be enough to justify the migration. In other cases, a single driver (such as cost savings) is greatly desired (or required) and sufficient to justify the migration.  


A successful and smooth migration to JBoss requires a strategic level of up-front planning and a proper understanding of the issues and challenges involved in order to minimize migration risks and costs. It is also important to understand the types of migrations that are possible as well as the potential deployment scenarios, as these may help proactively identify roadblocks and anticipate future needs. 


Whatever the particular drivers are, it is important to bear them in mind when planning migrations. Drivers help dictate priorities and methods when migrating. They are key to determining which migration scenario applies and how it should be deployed. For example, if a major driver is the desire to benefit from the latest features and capabilities, the migration project will need to delineate the features desired and determine which can be achieved by changing configurations and which will require updating source code.  

Potential Migration Scenarios
-----------------------------

Basic Web Appplication Migration:

Migrating basic web applications that were developed according to the servlet specification and Java EE specifications is the easiest and most cost-effective way to start migrations. It can be an excellent measure of the effort involved. If the applications were developed with a standards-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, this will go quite smoothly. Many proprietary IDEs embed links to proprietary libraries and thus can add additional challenges to migration.
 
  Migrating a web application that is developed and deployed to a specific application server can be very simple or somewhat complicated depending on how proprietary the application architecture and dependencies are. Many web applications can simply be copied over and directly deployed to JBoss with no changes at all.  

Java EE Migration:

  Migrating Java EE applications is in theory no more difficult than migrating pure web applications. However, the purpose of Java EE specifications is to facilitate the integration of multiple frameworks with diverse functionalities. This means that there will in practice be many mini-migrations involved.  

  If proprietary IDEs are used in the development of Java EE applications, these will often have the generated classes extend and implement proprietary classes and interfaces.
