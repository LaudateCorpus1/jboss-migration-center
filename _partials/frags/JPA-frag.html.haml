  Hibernate 4 is the default persistence component in JBoss EAP 6.  
  There may be application changes needed to use this version of Hibernate.
  You may need to make changes to your application to conform to JPA 2.0, replace the second level
  cache to use Infinipan, make adjustments to your definition of a CLOB,
  change the return type of  projections in org.hibernate.criterion, or make changes to 
  the application's persistence configuration file.

  changes.

  Alternatively you can install Hibernate 3 as a module and declare it be used by
  your application instead.
