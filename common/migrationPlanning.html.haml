      Migration Planning 
    %p 
      Every migration project, no matter the size or scope, requires detailed 
      planning to ensure success. 
      It is important to look at all facets of your IT environment. 
      Understand the risks, savings, and cost structure of your migration project.
      This information will enable you to accurately project net improvements 
      and realize actual return on your IT investment.  
    %p
      The considerations and processes detailed here are designed 
      to help you identify migration opportunities, examine the risks 
      associated with various migration scenarios, create a standard 
      migration process, and help develop a comprehensive strategic migration plan.  
    %p
      Prior to formal planning, an organization must acknowledge the 
      motivations behind the migration, as well as understand the 
      advantages and disadvantages to each potential migration 
      scenario. Lacking this understanding, organizations may be 
      unprepared for decisions and trade-offs that must be made 
      throughout the planning process. Once motivations are clear, 
      organizations should step through each of the four phases of 
      the strategic migration process detailed here. Those phases are: 
      %ol
        %li 
          Perform an application and infrastructure analysis.
        %li 
          Measure organizational readiness.
        %li 
          Develop a strategic migration plan
        %li 
          Implement the migration plan 
      %br

      %h4 Phase I: Application and Infrastructure Analysis
      %p 
        To ensure that business services are not disrupted in an unplanned fashion, a detailed 
        application and infrastructure assessment is needed. The purpose of this analysis 
        is to create a document package for each application, with sufficient understanding 
        of its current footprint, to evolve a clear, orderly, measurable migration strategy.
      %p
        The document package consistes of the following documents.  
      %ul
        %li
          Application Contacts 
        %li
          Infrastructure Analysis
        %li
          Application Dependencies
        %li
          Application Assessment
        %li
          Migration Plan 
      %br
      %h4 Application Contacts
      %p
        During the initial assessment phase of each application it is important to capture 
        the names of all current stakeholders that will enable key decisions pertaining to 
        the software and hardware infrastructure involved in the migration. 
        The table below illustrates a useful set of information about key stakeholders 
        for an application.  Usually these stakeholders will be involved in the planning,
        building and testing of components during the migration process and sign-off at
        the end of each phase.  
      %p
        Below is an example of information you will want to collect.

      %a{:href=>"#{site.base_url}/forms/application_contacts.odt"}application_contacts.odt 
      = partial( 'tables/application_contacts.html.haml' ) 
      %br
      %br
      %h4 Infrastructure analysis
      %p
        The infrastructure includes the full ecosystem in which the application server operates.
        This analysis is an inventory of the existing servers, network infrastructure, and applications. 
        It sets a baseline of existing functionality and load capacity.

      = partial( 'tables/infrastructure_analysis.html.haml' ) 
      %br
      %br
      %h4 Application Dependencies
      %p
        In order to be aware of the full scope of migration, it is 
        important to assess what technologies are currently used by 
        the applications and their migration targets. The typical 
        enterprise application makes use of several technologies 
        for security, caching, clustering, and injection. These 
        technologies are largely hidden from the average application 
        developer and they might not be aware of them, but they can 
        have a major impact on the performance and scalability of 
        the application.  
      %p
        This information will help prioritize and schedule 
        migration activities and breakdown the program into smaller more manageable work packages.  
      %p

      %br
      %h4 Application Assessment
      %p
        An assessment of the source code of each application to be migrated should be made 
        to determine its readiness to run in the new environment.  The code should be inspected 
        for proprietary libraries, adherence to Java EE component specification standards, 
        conflicting configuration requirements, etc. 

        Further analysis may be needed to determine how best to address identified technology gaps,
        find open source alternatives to proprietary APIs, and solutions to 
        configuration conflicts.  This information will enable you to scope the engineering
        time and effort required to migrate an application.  
      %p
        Windup is a free open source tool that can help with this assessment. 
        It will analyze your code and generates a report that identifies known issues.  
        In addition the report provides an estimate of effort required to make
        code changes and where appropriate, offers suggestions for replacement 
        code. [  LINK TO DISCOVER PAGE HERE ???? ] 
      %p
        It is helpful to maintain a spreadsheet of this information. It is a good reference document to 
        share and it can be used to generate more detailed project plans and to track project progress.

      %h4 Phase II: Organizational Readiness
      %p
        Organizational factors will generally prevail over technical factors. Technical factors
        can be easily delineated and addressed. Organizational factors lie beneath the surface and can derail efforts. Seemingly
        small hurdles can become insurmountable if the organization is unprepared or unwilling to address them.
        Without a plan for addressing issues, the organization can quickly become focused on minor
        shortcomings and overlook major opportunities for migrating to open source.  
      %p
        The first step in addressing organizational risk factors is to analyze organizational issues and risks.
        This will provide a roadmap for preparing the organization for the migration. Organizational readiness
        factors include.

        Taking these considerations into account for the migration plan will avoid unpleasant surprises and produce
        a successful migration.  
      %p
        A strength, weakness, opportunity and threats (SWOT) analysis can help define the organizational readiness.
        It basically helps the organization match up strengths and weakness, opportunities and threats, and then
        develop a plan to leverage strengths to overcome weaknesses.

      %h4 Phase III: Migration Plan
      %p
        Once the analysis is complete, migration bundles can be created based upon
        a careful evaluation of their logical interdependencies and business priorities.

        Each migration bundle should have a list of participating applications,
        implementation teams, and stakeholders who will sign off on work at
        the end of each phase.

      %h4 Phase IV: Migration Plan Implementation 
      %p 
        [THIS SECTION SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE TO PRESENT THE NEW MODEL, DEVELOPE FOR FREE,  .... GO TO PRODUCTION WITH A LICENSE. ] 
      %p
        When performing a migration is it important to use a standard 
        operating environment (SOE) upon which to migrate. An SOE is 
        an organization’s standard implementation of the core operating 
        system and middleware components. It should include the base operating 
        system, the JEE container, custom configurations, standard applications 
        used within an organization, software updates, and service packs.  
      %p
        Once an migration bundle has been identified, a standardized configuration 
        based on an SOE approach can be created for rapid and consistent deployment. 
        An SOE configuration consists of a set of tested hardware, tested software, 
        and configurations deployed within a JBoss environment. The SOE configuration 
        should be fully aligned to your technical and business requirements.
        It will dramatically reduce deployment time, simplify maintenance, increase 
        stability, and reduce support and management costs.  
      %p
        For each phase of a migration bundle's implementation from engineering 
        implementation through,
        QA validation and production deployment the appropriate stakeholder should review the
        work and signed-off on the phrase.
